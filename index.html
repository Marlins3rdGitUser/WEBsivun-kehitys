    <h2>Final notes:</h2>
    <p>
        This course has more or less been a refresher for me on how to do website development.
        <br> Although I've done this before, it was more of a surface of things, while this course was more in depth about it.
        <br> Things, such as <a>Bootstrap</a> and few other things I was not familiar with, so I guess I learned something new.
