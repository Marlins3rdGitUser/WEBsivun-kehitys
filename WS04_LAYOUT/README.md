Task Name:
Make a HTML layout or something using more confusing stuff.

Description:

Part 1: Make a Flexbox with 3 boxes alinged horizontally. 
(I made it with 4 boxes and aligned them vertically.)

Part 2: Create a Grid Layout with three columns and two rows.

Part 3: Add Media Queries that changes the background color based on the screen width. 
(Made it change both background and text color.)

Part 4: Use Semantic Elements to create a basic page strucutre.
(Made it seperate my previous pages contents from the new work.)

Part 5 is the same old "Validate HTML and CSS using W3C." I did it and it's super buggy (The W3C, not my website.)
