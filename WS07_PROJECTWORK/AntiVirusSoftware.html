                <h1>Basics of an Antivirus and where it comes from</h1>
                <p class="py-3">
                    Antivirus software, as mentioned in the homepage, is a type of software that detects 
                    malicious programs, softwares or applications (Commonly known as Malware) and often 
                    informs the user about the mentioned malware or tries to stop the malware by itself,
                    either by deleting the malware or stopping it from running.
                    <br>
                    First antivirus was created around 1980-1990, as internet became more available and computer viruses began appearing in the internet.
                    This information comes from wikipedia, so if you wish to read more into this topic, here is the link:

                    <br>
                    Nowdays, most devices if not all have some sort of antivirus. But the question is which ones are good an which ones are bad.
                </p>
                <h2>Here are three different antivirus softwares.</h2>

                    <h3>Windows Defender</h3>
                    <p>
                        Windows defender is widely seen as solid baseline antivirus software for windows based devices.
                        It is seen as the standard antivirus software for anybody not installing 50 million malwares at once.
                        It is also free and is preinstalled with windows, with a premium version existing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, it is quite slow in doing it's job. It's said that it takes a moment for it to detect and prevent different malwares from executing.
                        Sometimes it may also not even detect any malware and just do nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But overall, it is often quoted to be "Good enough" for most windows users, but if someone wants very good antivirus,
                        there are defenitely better alternatives than windows defender.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/Bitdefender-Logo.png" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="Bitdefender Logo">
                    <h3>Bitdefender</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bitdefender is often recomended due to the good protection that is offers and it's efficeny at preventing
                        malware from executing if it were to be actived. Bitdefender also has a very good threat detection, capapble of
                        finding most computer viruses pretty quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, it's downsides are that it's behaviour based antivirus, which mean that it will use alot more of computers resources to do it's job. 
                        It is also less controllable compared to other antivirus softwares and more agressive on malware detection which causes it to have false positives. 
                        It is also mentioned to have a quite pricy premium version of an antivirus software, which is often on discount. It also appearntly has auto-renewal¨
                        and can be quite problematic to deal with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, bitdefender is quite a powerful piece of antivirus software with very good detection and protection peformance, it is also similary
                        more demaning in terms of computer resources and pricing is quite high for some people. But if you want a super solid and greatly rated piece of antivirus
                        software, bitdefender might be something you should consider.

                    <h3>McAfee Antivirus</h3>
                    <p>
                        McAfee Antivirus is "said" to be good piece of antivirus software. (Advertised more likely.) It seems to be able to detect quite alot of different
                        malwares and be able to stop them from acting... Thats about it for the positives. There are ALOT more negatives to be said about
                        this piece of software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        McAfee Antivirus is quoted to be a "virus disquised as antivirus" and it is not hard to see why. First of all, if you don't have the premium plan
                        which costs quite alot so it's already a negative, make McAfee constantly notify you about upgrading to a premium plan. It has auto-renewal feature
                        that is quite annoying to deal with if you want to cancel the subscription. Then there are numerous false positives which come from this piece of shoveware 
                        which yes, it was pre-installed in some computer/laptop devices. There have also been complaints about it's resource use and the software not doing anything
                        when there are actual malware active. And when you feel like you've had enough of it and decide to delete it... It is a pain to have uninstalled, with it 
                        leaving traces of itself in the system which are itself a pain to deal with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarize it: McAfee is advertised to be a good piece of antivirus software, but that maybe the case if you are subscribed to it.
                        But in reality, customer reviews often say that is a constantly falsely detecting bloatware, that constantly spams the user with notifications about the 
                        premium subscription of McAfee appearntly barely functions as an antivirus. It is also very annoying to get rid off, as it leaves pieces of itself in the system.
