                <p>
                    Computer viruses or commonly known as Malware, are a types of programs that are often maliciously harmful to the computer.<br>
                    Malware comes in various different forms and not all of them are made equally. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Malware typically hijacks the systems in order to hide itself and do what it is meant to do. <br>
                    Malware is often made to do one of three different things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To make money by stealing information from the device, system or the network and selling it. (Info stealers such as Trojan Virus)</li>
                    <li>To encrypt all the files within the device, system or network and demand a ransom for their decryption. (Ransonware)</li>
                    <li>To convert the device into a money maker (Usually into a cryptominer via Cryptojacker).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Of course, sometimes malware is made to destroy the entire system for a reason or another.

                    AntiVirus softwares are commonly used to detect and get rid of the mentioned malware.<br>
                    Although just like malware, not all Antiviruses are built equally and often miss different types malware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Antivirus software was created in response to increased amounts of computer viruses that were active back when internet usage had started to become common.
                    Nowdays antivirus softwares are found in every device, being used to prevent malware from hijacking and destroying the mentioned device.
