Task Name: 
Advanced CSS techniques

Description:
Making more style edits using less used CSS things.

Basically: 

1. Make a button that changes color

2. Make a box that moves

3. Make a list have different colors on each different item.

4. Make an image grayscale unless hovered over (I made it blured and inverted when not hovered over because it was already black and white)

5. Make a quote.
